                After graduating from Tufts University I worked as a data consultant
                in NYC. This last year I taught English to elementary school students in
                Shenzhen, China. It may seem like I'm all over the place, but I've gained
                valuable experience everywhere I've been. Now I'm ready to sink my teeth
                into a career as a software developer, problem solver, and team player.
